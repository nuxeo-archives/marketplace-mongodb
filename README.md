marketplace-mongodb
===================

Introduction
------------

This marketplace package is an EXPERIMENTAL package to allow testing of
the preliminary (alpha) code (nuxeo-storage-mongodb) that uses MongoDB
as a storage backend instead of a SQL database.

It applies currently on top of a Nuxeo Platform 5.9.4 distribution.

When installed, a new "mongodb" template is activated, which contains
configuration for an additional Nuxeo repository (in addition to the
default one) using MongoDB as a backend.
